# Tasks Overview

## Task 1: Binary Representations

**Objective:** Implement bitwise operations commonly used in computational theory.

### Steps:

1. **Bitwise Rotation Functions:**
   - Implement `rotl(x, n)`: Rotates bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer `x` to the left by `n` places.
   - Implement `rotr(x, n)`: Rotates bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer `x` to the right by `n` places.

2. **Logical Bitwise Functions:**
   - Implement `ch(x, y, z)`: Chooses bits from `y` where `x` has bits set to 1 and from `z` where `x` has bits set to 0.
   - Implement `maj(x, y, z)`: Computes the majority function, setting a bit if at least two of `x, y, z` have it set.

3. **Testing and Demonstration:**
   - Provide example inputs for each function.
   - Print outputs in binary format to verify correctness.
